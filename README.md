# Animals Classifier using Deep Convolutional Neural Network
<p> In this notebook you will see the all  process  for  building powerfull classifier. Here I'm using three multiple classes for making powerfull and complete Animal Classifier.</p>

## Dataset :

Here in this project I am using an animals dataset  with three classes. In this dataset my goal is to  classify animals and predict the animal names. 

<b>Training Data<b><br>
  Dog : 2000 Samples<br>
  Bird:  2000 Samples<br>
  Tiger:2000 Samples<br>


## Convolutional Neural Network :

In deep learning Convolutional Neural Network is a class of deep neural network, the term convolutional refers to the mathematical  combination of two functions to produce a third function. In case of a CNN the convolutional is performed  on the input data with the use of a filter or kernal to produce a feature map.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs / ConvNets) ... ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.
